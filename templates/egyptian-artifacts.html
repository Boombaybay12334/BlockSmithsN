                <h3>The Canopic jar</h3>
                <p>Details: The Canopic Jar is a type of ancient Egyptian vessel specifically designed to hold the internal organs of the deceased during the mummification process.<br>
                    Origin: These jars originated in Egypt, with their use dating back to the Old Kingdom around 2600 BCE.<br>
                    History: Canopic jars were integral to Egyptian burial practices, reflecting the belief in the afterlife. Each jar was associated with one of the Four Sons of Horus, who were believed to protect the organs: Imsety (human head for the liver), Hapy (baboon head for the lungs), Duamutef (jackal head for the stomach), and Qebehsenuef (falcon head for the intestines).<br>                   
                    Place: This particular jar is housed in the British Museum, London, and is a notable example of the craftsmanship of the 26th Dynasty (664-525 BCE).<br>                
                    Price: Authentic canopic jars can range in price from $1,500 to $10,000, depending on their age, condition, and provenance, while replicas are available for approximately $50 to $200.</p>

                <h3>Scarabs</h3>
                <p>Details: Scarabs are ancient Egyptian amulets modeled after the dung beetle, symbolizing rebirth, regeneration, and protection in the afterlife. They were often inscribed with names and used as seals, charms, and decorative objects.<br>

                    Origin: The first known scarab amulets appeared during the 6th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom (2649-2150 BC). Initially, they were simple stone seals, evolving in complexity and significance over time.<br>
                    
                    History: Scarabs gained religious importance during the New Kingdom (1550-1070 BC), often inscribed with the names of gods or pharaohs. They were believed to aid the deceased in the afterlife, particularly the larger "Heart Scarabs," which were placed in tombs or mummy wrappings. The scarab was closely associated with the sun god Khepri, symbolizing the eternal cycle of life and death.<br>
                    
                    Place: Scarabs can be found in various museums, including the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They are also popular in modern markets, where replicas are sold as souvenirs.<br>
                    
                    Price: The price of authentic ancient Egyptian scarabs can vary significantly:
                    
                    Authentic Scarabs: Prices can range from $500 to $10,000 or more, depending on age, material, and provenance.<br>
                    Replicas: Modern replicas are available for approximately $20 to $200 in souvenir shops and online marketplaces.</p>
